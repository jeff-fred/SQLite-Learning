# Learning SQLite3 with Python
*Applied the SQLite3 application into a Tkinter Login/Signup GUI.*

------

> Starting with the Tkinter GUI

1. Creating the main window
    1. Made this basic Tk() window where frames could be added into and changed.
    2. Frames are created seperately and stored into Dictionary.
    3. Frames are called by main class method when commanded by Frame buttons.

2. Creating the Frames
    1. Pretty basic frames.
    2. Stored tk.Entry() widget information inside the init function for each frame for easy calling. 
    3. Attached main database command into Frame buttons by importing directly.

> Applying SQLite3 DataBase

1. Pretty simple database, three columns
2. Learned a little of SQL syntax by completing this project.
3. Created and implemented a lot of useful database management functions into the data_management.py file for easy use with the frames.
4. Implemented these functions into the buttons of the Frames themselves.
5. Functions created basically allowed me to create, delete, view, add and modify data in the database by specific search.
